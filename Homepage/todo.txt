diagnose undefined issue
possible solutions:

make id constant, never change it, always increasing it

maybe its to do with not parsing events as objects at some point so they become undefined

only effects edited events

when page reloads, the date objects change to 1970??

edit popup stuff

add edit title to edit popup
move buttons to edit popup
add tags for pin and archived instead

add popup for delete

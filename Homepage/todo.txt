implement loading and saving:

FIGURE OUT COMPLEXITY OF GETTING NODE.JS TO WORK IN BROWSER
but if we want to run in browser we need to use localStorage instead of fs
nodejs doesnt work on browsers, maybe theres a way around that
the other option is using browser localStorage, which would need stringifying and parsing
see "convert nodejs Code" in chatgpt




figure out better way to display
change delete to archive
add tags for pin and archived instead


add an edit popup:
find a way to set default values in all the fields
maybe can run script that sets default values in all the fields by finding "edit-title"

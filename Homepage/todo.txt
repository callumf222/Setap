diagnose undefined issue
possible solutions:

keep track of localStorage in f12

make id constant, never change it, always increasing it

maybe its to do with not parsing events as objects at some point so they become undefined

only effects edited events

when page reloads, the date objects change to 1970??

edit popup stuff


add tags for pin and archived instead

i think check for getting events by events[id] as this wont work
replace with events.find(event => event.id === id)
